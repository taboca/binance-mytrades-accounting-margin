# binance-mytrades-accounting

Check this [article](https://mgalli-com-dev.medium.com/using-binance-api-to-get-the-users-trading-history-e459c643878b) for the basic information in this article. 

Additionally, this project now includes the contents from https://github.com/jaggedsoft/node-binance-api however modifed, patched, so that binance.trades works with the margin account. Ideally it would make sense to post/contribute to the https://github.com/jaggedsoft/node-binance-api project and avoid including that project within this one.
